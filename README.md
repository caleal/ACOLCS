# ACOLCS
Ant Colony Optimization, also known as ACO, is a metaheuristic that uses search agents to
traverse the search space in a probabilistic manner. The search agents‟ behavior is modeled after the motions of
ants in real life through the use of a pheromone model that dictates a given search agent‟s cycle through the search
space. This study aims to apply the metaheuristic on the Longest Common Subsequence problem, such that its
performance, whether in terms of time or space complexity, may be improved upon.
